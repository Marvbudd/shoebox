  <h1>CDROM Software Installation</h1>

    <li>When you install the software you may need to use the File menu (ALT-F or CMD-F) to select
      the location of the accessions.json file. Alongside it should be the audio, video, photo,
      and website sub directories. These files may be on any local storage.</li>

  <h1>About This Software</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>There are two major sections of shoebox: This is the media part, which
      contains photos, audio and video sorted in different ways. The other part
      has family trees and pedigrees. Try ALT-W F to open it.</li>

    <li>This is the result of years of family research in my "spare"
      time. This version is the second rewrite of the original that ran in Internet Explorer
      and Windows 98 back in 2001!</li>

    <li>The left frame contains the list of media that can be viewed. 
      The background color indicates if the item is audio, video or photo. 
      It can be sorted in several ways using the drop down box below. The checkboxes
      select whether audio, video or photos are shown. The background color 
      matches the media type.</li>

    <li>To select a picture or audio clip move your mouse pointer over the left
      column and wait momentarily while the item is displayed. Photos are displayed
      on the right, and video/audio are shown in a new window.
      You may listen to audio or view video while simultaneously viewing photos. Both windows 
      can be used at the same time.</li>

    <li>Some photos, such as Chester or Erma Budd's photo album videos, have been
      matched to photos that have been scanned. Look below photos in the detail section.
      If a video or audio file has mentioned that photo mousing over those lines will
      play the media where it is discussed. 
      I am currently matching more selections but this takes a long time.</li>

    <li>Dates on pictures are approximate and are usually guesses.</li>

    <li>Persons in photos are listed left to right, back to front.</li>

    <li>Both married and maiden names have been used to alphabetize and identify 
      all people.</li>

    <li>Bricks for Sale has not been closely proofread. This book is included in 
      the sources for Peter Barker. Italicized words in the
      original may be unitalicized. Volunteer proofreaders please send me
      corrections! Chester Budd's poetry is included in his sources.</li>
    
    <li>There is a playlist of explanatory videos available on 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8z7p1h74xBqbjDLCWjncm9EF5RL7oTDP">YouTube</a>.</li>
    
    <li>You can create your own subset of media using the Collections in shoebox. See the 
      Edit menu for how to create and delete collections. You can also export collections to
      a subdirectory using the File menu. The export will create a new directory with the
      same name as the collection and will contain a new accessions.json file and a commands file
      that is for a linux system, but can be edited to run on other platforms.</li>  
  </ul>
