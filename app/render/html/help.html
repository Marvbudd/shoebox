  <h1>CDROM Software Installation</h1>

    <li>When you install the software you may need to use the File menu to select
      the location of the accessions.xml file and the audio, video and photo sub directories.
      These files may be on a CDROM or DVD, or on your hard drive.</li>

  <h1>About This Software</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>This is the result of years of family research in my "spare"
      time. This version is a rewrite of the original that ran in Internet Explorer
      and Windows 98 back in 2001!</li>

    <li>The left frame contains the list of media that can be viewed. 
      The background color indicates if the item is audio, video or photo. 
      It can be sorted in several ways using the drop down box below. The checkboxes
      select whether audio, video or photos are shown. The background color 
      matches the media type.</li>

    <li>To select a picture or audio clip move your mouse pointer over the left
      column and wait momentarily while the item is displayed. Photos are displayed
      on the right, and video/audio are shown in a new window.
      You may listen to audio or view video while simultaneously viewing photos.</li>

    <li>Some photos, such as Chester or Erma Budd's photo albums, have been
      matched to photos that have been scanned. Look below photos in the detail section.
      If a video or audio file has mentioned that photo mousing over those lines will
      play the media where it is discussed. 
      I am currently matching more selections but this takes a long time.</li>

    <li>Dates on pictures are approximate and are usually guesses.</li>

    <li>Persons in photos are listed left to right, back to front.</li>

    <li>Both married and maiden names have been used to alphabetize and identify 
      all people.</li>

    <li>Bricks for Sale has not been closely proofread. Italicized words in the
      original may be unitalicized. Volunteer proofreaders please send me
      corrections!</li>
  </ul>
