# Getting Started

Welcome to Shoebox! This guide will help you get up and running with your personal family history archive.

## What is Shoebox?

Shoebox is a desktop application designed to help you organize, preserve, and share your family's multimedia memories. Think of it as your digital shoebox—a place to store and curate photos, videos, and audio recordings with rich contextual information.

## Key Concepts

Before diving in, let's clarify some important terminology:

### Archive
Your **archive** is your complete collection of multimedia files and associated metadata. This is the master dataset you're building and curating over time. In Shoebox, everything revolves around managing and enriching your archive.

### Collection
A **collection** is a subset of items from your archive. You can create collections for:
- Sharing with specific family members
- Themed groupings (birthdays, vacations, etc.)
- Time periods or generations
- Presentations or slideshows

Collections don't duplicate files—they're references to items in your main archive.

## Installation

See the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) for platform-specific instructions.

## First Launch

When you first open Shoebox, you'll find a sample archive already loaded. This lets you:

- Explore the interface without setting up your own data
- Try out features like slideshow mode and face detection
- Learn keyboard shortcuts with real content
- Understand the data structure before importing your own files

Take some time to browse the sample archive. Navigate using arrow keys, try the slideshow (press Space), and explore the metadata panel.

## Quick Tour

### Main Window

The main window is divided into several areas:

1. **Header** (top): Shows current item metadata and controls
2. **Navigation** (left): Browse your archive chronologically or by collection - hover over items to preview
3. **Preview Area** (center/right): See the selected item with full details
4. **Metadata Panel**: Expandable detailed information for each item

### Navigation Basics

- **Up/Down Arrow Keys**: Move between items in the navigation list
- **Mouse Hover**: Move your mouse over items in the navigation list to preview them
- **Enter**: View selected item in detail
- **Space**: Start slideshow mode
- **Escape**: Exit full-screen modes

For a complete list, see the [Keyboard Shortcuts](./keyboard-shortcuts.md) reference.

### Sorting and Finding Items

Use the sort dropdown at the bottom of the window to organize your archive:

- **By Date**: Chronological order (earliest to latest)
- **By Person**: Alphabetically by person's last name
  - **Tip**: People appear under ALL their last names (maiden and married), making it easy to find anyone regardless of how they're known
- **By Location**: Organized by state, city, then detail
- **By Source**: Who provided each item
- **By File**: Filename order
