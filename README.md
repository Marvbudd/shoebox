This is an electron project that displays multimedia files with descriptive information about each file.

As I was collecting photo albums, photos, videos of interviews with older living relatives, and recordings of interviews and visits to historic and sites with significant relevance to my family history I put them in a big "shoebox" until I could curate them for others to use. It was difficult to share these rare items with others who wanted them, and the information I collected about them was as valuable as the items. 

This project is my answer to the need to make this information available. The original was started during the 9/11 era when I was off work for a year. It was written for Window 98 and Internet Explorer. Javascript was cool, and not needing to install additional software made this attractive. Unfortunately, this choice made the result inaccessible to Apple products, and *nix, and as browser technology became more secure it did not run at all.

Years later Node.js, electron, and updated standards may offer greater access to similar technologies. Lets see if this promise may come true.

This is a project that I hope will gain appropriate attention among the free software movement, and if it does not live on, perhaps a superset will become available. I'm not going to be around to gain profit from this. But I want the information in my research to be available to future researchers.

The git@github.com:Marvbudd/shoebox.git private project is the current repository for the software, and I'm still looking for appropriate data storage for the items in my database that this indexes. Please email me with your needs and ideas. I'm looking for collaborators.
