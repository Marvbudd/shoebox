This is a project that displays multimedia files with descriptive information about each file.

As I was collecting photos, videos of interviews with older living relatives, and recordings of interviews and visits to historic and sites with significant relevance to my family history I put them in a big "shoebox" until I could curate them for others to use. It was difficult to share these rare items with others who wanted them, and the information I collected about them was almost as valuable as the items. 

This project is my answer to the need to make this information available. The original was started during the 9/11 era when I was off work for a year. It was written for Window 98 and Internet Explorer. Javascript was cool, and not needing to install additional software made this attractive. Unfortunately, this choice made the result inaccessible to Apple and *nix users, and as browser technology became more secure it did not run at all.

With this software, written in Electron/Node.js, I include a subset of the media for my family that is customized to the part of the family they share with me. Then I add my pedigree and genealogy research using a product called Second Site by John Cardinal. This all is written to a data DVD for them to install on their computer. 

To Install: First look in the DVD for the installer appropriate for your operating system. x.x.x is the shoebox version.
  Apple Mac  - shoebox-x.x.x.AppImage
  Windows 10 - shoebox Setup x.x.x.exe
  Linux      - shoebox-x.x.x.dmg

After the install completes the software can be run and only a sample set of files is installed. You can then either copy the files from the DVD to an empty directory on your computer, or direct shoebox to open the DVD directly. To select the location press <ALT>F for Windows/Linux or <CTRL>F for Mac to access the menu. Then select "Choose Accessions.xml file" from the menu. Use the dialog to find and double click on the accessions.xml file on your computer or on the DVD as needed. Now the full set of media are available. This selection is retained for future use by shoebox.

The github.com:Marvbudd/shoebox.git is the current project repository. Please email me with your needs and ideas. I'm looking for collaborators.
